# Engagement Recognition


The project aims to build an engagement recognition model that can accurately detect the affective state of an individual. The DAiSEE Dataset consists of videos of subjects during online courses and are available under different illumination settings. Each video is labelled with one of 4 affective states - boredom, engagement, confusion, frustration. Further each affective state is also rated based on the intensity ranging from 0-3.

# Dataset and Experimentation
User engagement recognition model to predict userâ€™s affective state in a multi -view video conference. Using snippets from a dataset of 9068 videos
and 112 users to analyze user engagement.

We use teh [DAiSEE Dataset](https://docs.activeloop.ai/datasets/daisee-dataset) for this project which consists of videos of subjects during online classes and the model tries to classify the engagement into 4 affective states - boredom, engagement, confusion and frustation. To find the intensity of each state, we rate them from a range of 0-3.

Due to lack of computational power in our systems, the only a samll section of the actual dataset was used which reflects in our results.
